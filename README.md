To use this program you have to use 1920x1080 resolution. This is hard coded curently, but will be changed in the future. It supports dart castle impoppable, medium, and custom odysseys. You have to change the code in order to configure the odyssey based on the week's maps. 

To start the script you need to go into the selected level and difficulty with the proper hero. For the dark castle maps you should use quincy. Dark castle impoppable is reliant on monkey knowledge, so if you die using it you should use the medium. 

If you want to code a script to afk odyssey's you need to write the code for the towers and upgrades on your own, because each week the maps change. It is very basic to do if you have any python experience.
